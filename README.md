TODO:

- [x] Allow entering number _or_ module name

- [x] If only one result was found, use that result

- [ ] Branch/hash selection:

  - Fetch all branches
  - Filter branches by those which are valid version numbers
    - Not sure the heuristic to use here, e.g. "starts with `v`, has numbers, etc."?
  - Fetch latest commit hash on main branch
  - Show following options in a list selection, "Version / branch: "
    - Use latest version (v1.0.0)
    - Use latest commit hash (abdcef)
    - Use master branch
    - Use something else
      - This will show a prompt which lets the user enter a branch name or version
